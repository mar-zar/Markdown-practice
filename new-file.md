# Paragraph of text with line break
To create a line break or new line, end a line with two or more spaces, and then type return.  
Like this.  
This actually works.  
<!-- Example of another paragraph -->
You can also use some of html <br> Does this work? <br> Yes!<br>Is it a new line?<br> Yes! <p> Is it a new paragraph? <br> Yes!</p>

# Emphasis  
## Bold    
To bold text, add two asterisks or underscores before and after a word or phrase.   
It **really** works. Use the one __you__ like.   
But it's better to use asterisks if you want to bold some part of a word. Like finding some art in your own name: M**art**a. See?
## Italics    
To italicize text, add one asterisk or underscore before and after a word or phrase.  
And just like *that* you've got yourself _italics_.    
It works in the middle of a word too. M*art*a. 
## Bold and italics
That's simple! One asterisk for italics, two for bold... Add them up and ***there you go***. ___Three underscores___ will do the job as well. 
## Crossing out
Use double tilde to show how much you don't like something. 
For example, Rick Astley would:  
tell you how he is feeling  
~~give you up  
let you down  
run around and desert you~~
